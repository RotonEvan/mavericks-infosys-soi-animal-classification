# mavericks-infosys-soi-animal-classification
Developing deep learning models which could be used to detect animals from short range (10mts) or long range (100mts)

Train the model using binaryimageclassification.ipynb
The model will get saved as a .h5 file

Load the model from binarypredict.py.ipynb and run for validation
